## 1. Introduction - headers
we can create headers by placing

### 1.1 You can create bold and italic text
for example *italic* uses two stars
additionally you can create **bold** by using four stars

```{r}
a<-5
a+5
```
you can also add inline code, we know that 2+2 is `r 2+2`

## 2. Section 2 - style and bullets
For example, in R Markdown, you can use lists as such:

1. This is the first element
2. This is the second element

```{r}
print ('This is another piece of code')
```
